NubyDocs
========

Welcome to the revised version of [Ruby Docs](http://ruby-doc.org/).  This site is dictionary for ruby methods and objects.  It is not meant to be blog posts that explain methods in detail, but rather a site to clarify what methods do. 

We hope that this site will be less intmiidating for Ruby Noobs.

Please contact us if you would like to contribute or edit.  


Thank you!
