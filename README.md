NubyDocs
========

Mission: Provide more user friendly definitions and examples for ruby new comers.

Goal: We will publish all the content created here on www.rubydocs.com.  When first learning ruby we used rubydocs heavily to learn the basics, and were thankful for it. However, a lot of the definitions and examples on rubydocs were often unclear and many times left us more confused than when we started.  Our goal with nuby docs is to make a simple, easy to understand version of ruby docs aimed at newbies to really help them get started.

Get involved:  Clone the repo and choose term that hasn't been defined and offer a definition and example to go with it!  

Format:  When defining something, try to use human langauge, and give easy concrete examples that leave little or no doubt how it is used.  Don't get hung up and providing the most comprehensive definition.  Newbies just want the best use case senario, they don't have to know every scenario it's use in.   

Here is the model you should use when defining a term:

Class: String
Method: Center
Defintion: the center method centers the letters/numbers (characters/variables) inside the quotation marks.
Example: 
#=> "hello".center(20)        
#=> "       hello        "
Used: Rarely
