Hashes
Basic Definition
A hash is an unordered collection of information where each stored value is accessed through a label(referred to as a 'key').


Basic Components
A hash has zero or more pairs of a 'key' and a 'value' contained within the open '{' and closed '}' brackets. We can express this relationship in two ways: 

* We want to put our inventory (3 'apples', 2 'bananas', and 1 'orange') into a hash named 'inventory':* 

1. The Rocket

inventory = {'apples' => 3, 'bananas' => 2, 'oranges' => 1}

2. Symbols
*add link to symbols page*
inventory = {apples: 3, bananas: 2, oranges: 1}

Here, 'apples', 'bananas', and 'oranges' are each a *key*, with their respective *values* '3', '2', and '1'.
